<div><center><p><h3>Hello friends, welcome to my first ever webpage! As you can see it's not fully constructed yet, so bear with me as I'll be making changes periodically. First off, I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Joseph, I'm 25 years old, and I'm from Missouri. I'm also currently studying coding through LaunchCode.</h3></p>
  <p><h3>I plan on using what I learn in class to get into a career in game design. I love video games, I have been playing games since I was seven years old. The first console I ever played was the Nintendo Entertainment System, or the NES for short. In my lifetime I have owned up to twelve systems, the most recent being an Xbox One. Needless to say, I'm kind of a geek when it comes to anything regarding video games.</h3></p>
  <p><h3>My favorite aspect of gaming is the multiplayer aspect. There's nothing better than playing a game with friends online from almost anywhere in the world. My favorite game to play online is Overwatch. I own and play it on the Xbox One. It's an incredibly fun and addictive game to play.</h3></p>
